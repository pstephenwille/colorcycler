colorcycler
===========

Cycle through colors on nav buttons.  Includes separate mouse states and colors: over, off, &amp; on.

Parsed out this bit of functionality from another project.  
This was an early learning project done in 2010, and used only JS; no jQuery.
When updated, jQuery could reduce the code.
